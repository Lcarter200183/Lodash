There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ðŸ˜„
Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

1. Understanding the Node.js Package Manager (NPM)
   What is NPM?
   NPM is a package manager for JavaScript.
   Think of it like an "App Store" for Node.js projects.
   It allows developers to install, update, and remove third-party libraries.
   What is a Package?
   A package (or module) is a reusable piece of code that others have built.
   It can be a library, a tool, or a framework.
   Where do packages come from?
   The NPM Registry hosts thousands of open-source JavaScript packages.
2. Setting Up a Node.js Project
   ðŸ”¹ Creating a project using NPM
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   npm init
   This generates a package.json file, which keeps track of installed dependencies.
   ðŸ”¹ Installing a package (e.g, lodash
   ðŸ”¹ Why is package.json important?
   Keeps track of installed dependencies.
   Stores project metadata (name, version, author, etc.).
   Allows version control to ensure everyone on a team has the same
   dependencies.
   ðŸ”¹ Checking Installed Packages
   npm list
   ðŸ“Œ Key Concept: package.json makes it easy to install all dependencies in a project
   by running:
   npm install
   This restores all packages listed under "dependencies" .
